# Dialog Rendering
This example illustrates how to organize a GUI framework into independent modules using <strong>dynamic dispatch</strong>:

1. The `gui` module defines interfaces for all the components. It has no external dependencies.
2. The `html_gui` module provides HTML implementation of the base GUI.
Depends on `gui`.
3. The windows_gui module provides Windows implementation of the base GUI.
Depends on `gui`.
The `app` is a client application that can use several implementations of the GUI framework, depending on the current environment or configuration. However, most of the app code doesnâ€™t depend on specific types of GUI elements. All client code works with GUI elements through abstract interfaces defined by the `gui` module.
